# code-everyday

Welcome to my Code-Everyday repository! This is a personal project where I aim to improve my coding skills and maintain consistency by coding every single day. Here you will find a variety of mini-projects, challenges, and code snippets, all serving the purpose of daily practice.

## Current Activity

**10 Days of JavaScript on HackerRank**

I'm currently working on the "10 Days of JavaScript" challenge on HackerRank. This challenge is a great way to brush up on JavaScript fundamentals and problem-solving skills.

You can find my solutions and progress in the [10DaysOfJS](./10DaysOfJS) folder.

## Upcoming Activities

I'm always on the lookout for new and exciting challenges that can help me improve as a developer. While I haven't finalized my next task yet, I'm considering various resources, including LeetCode, Codewars, and other similar platforms. Stay tuned for updates!

## Contributions

While this project primarily serves as a personal exercise, I'm open to collaborative learning! Feel free to explore the repository, provide feedback, or suggest other interesting coding challenges.
